## Project Overview

Father Joseph Veneroso (affectionately known as Father Bae) is a 75-year-old Italian-American Maryknoll priest whose service spans from missionary work in Korea during the 1970s and 1980s to decades of dedicated pastoral care at St. Paul's. This tribute event, organized by the Cornerstone group—an English-speaking, faith-based, Korean-American Catholic gathering—aims to celebrate his legacy through storytelling, video reflections, and a community dinner.

### Father Bae's Impact

Father Bae has touched countless lives through his:
- Profound spiritual guidance to generations of Korean-American Catholics
- Cultural bridge-building between Korean and American traditions
- Insightful writings and sermons that blend Eastern and Western perspectives
- Compassionate pastoral care during life's most significant moments
- Dedication to nurturing faith in the Korean-American community
