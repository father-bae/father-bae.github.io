# Father Joseph Veneroso (Father Bae) Tribute Project

This repository contains materials and planning documents for a special tribute event honoring Father Joseph Veneroso, a beloved Maryknoll priest who has served the St. Paul Chong-ha Sang Roman Catholic Church community in Flushing, NY.

## Project Overview

Father Joseph Veneroso (affectionately known as Father Bae) is a 75-year-old Italian-American Maryknoll priest whose service spans from missionary work in Korea during the 1970s and 1980s to decades of dedicated pastoral care at St. Paul's. This tribute event, organized by the Cornerstone group—an English-speaking, faith-based, Korean-American Catholic gathering—aims to celebrate his legacy through storytelling, video reflections, and a community dinner.
